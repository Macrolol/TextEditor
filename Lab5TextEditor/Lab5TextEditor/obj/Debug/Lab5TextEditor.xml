<member name="M:Lab5TextEditor.frmTextEdit.mnuCopy_Click(System.Object,System.EventArgs)">

 Boring old copy event. Quite simple it just sets the clipboard text to the selected text

 <param name="e"></param>
</member>
<member name="M:Lab5TextEditor.frmTextEdit.mnuCut_Click(System.Object,System.EventArgs)">
 <summary>
 This is the cut event, it is slightly more involved than the copy event. First it stores the cursor 
 location, then sets the text in the textbox to be the text that was in the textbox - the selected text.
 It then puts the cursor back to were it was. The cursor part probably wasn't needed but it felt weird that
 it would reset it to the beginning.

<member name="M:Lab5TextEditor.frmTextEdit.mnuPaste_Click(System.Object,System.EventArgs)">
 <summary>
 This is the paste event, slightly more involved than cut. Saves cursor position,
 removes the selected text and inserts the clipboard text. Then it puts the cursor at the end of
 the pasted text. Once again the cursor stuff wasn't nessisary but it makes me feel good.
